      <h3>What is something vexing that you're currently wrestling with?</h3>
      <br><br>
      <p>The variations of laptops go on forever. Infinite. Or at least that’s how it feels. 
      <br><br>
      Choosing a laptop to use for the next four years of college is tough! (Fingers crossed it lasts that long.) Apple or Windows? What’s the perfect balance between screen size and weight? Processing power? What are all these new units??
      <br><br>
      Being a course 6-3 who knows nothing about hardware, it’s weird how I have no knowledge about something so vital.
      <br><br>
      Before looking for a laptop, I had to lay down my needs and wants. MacOS would allow me to create mobile apps for iPhones with Xcode and Swift. Windows computers have better hardware and processing power, as I’ve heard. Apple is sleek and beautiful but they don’t offer touchscreen capabilities. Windows not only has that but also detachable or flippable screens for tablet mode, an ability that’ll come in handy when I want to digitally draw. A long battery life is essential, and I dislike how Apple requires dongles for seemingly every new product.
      <br><br>
      So far, I know I want a Windows computer with a built-in tablet mode. I’ll likely purchase Parallels ($80) to get every other OS virtually housed in my computer as well. However, anything more specific than that is to be decided by future-me. (And Best Buy.)</p>
