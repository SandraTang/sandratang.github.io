How do you think an alarm clock feels, meant to wake you up, yet it carries a snooze button: a built-in function to render it useless, a failure, a counterproductive feature.

Do you ever feel like that alarm clock? When you try so hard, but it feels like life was built to go against you? When you don't know what was wrong, but it all went wrong? And you begin to worry, is it just me? Do I carry a snooze button, that automatic, built-in failure?

We all fail. We all fail to meet our goals every now and then. But that alarm clock will keep trying, no matter how many times you hit that snooze button. It's a resilient, stubborn little machine. The snooze button may stop it for a minute, but a minute later, it's back up, ringing, alive and kicking.

Embrace your inner alarm clock. Own up to your past mistakes. But don't let them stop you from trying, from continuing to work towards your goals. Don't let one push of a button knock you down. One day, you'll rise and shine and accomplish your dreams.
