  <h3>My TGSSI Experience</h3>
  <p><i>Perhaps one of my most wack but informative weekends</i><p>
  <hr>
  <p><b>A quick overview of what TGSSI and TGS are.<b>
  The Gates Scholarship Summer Institute (TGSSI) is a four-day-long program run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Hispanic Scholarship Fund. Bringing together all three-hundred annually selected Gates Scholars, it not only teaches attendees about the scholarship, college, and career-building but also provides opportunities to network and make friends. It is only one of the many benefits provided by The Gates Scholarship (TGS), a prestigious last-dollar undergraduate college scholarship for low-income minorities in the United States.

  <p><b>Wednesday Night</b>
  <br><br>
  I hastily finish packing my bags and head to the airport for the first leg of a series of red-eye flights. After navigating through the hectic no-man's-land that is LAX, I finally make it into the terminal, past TSA, and to my gate. 
  <br><br>
  For some reason (probably to save that coin), the program staff placed a group of scholars and I (all from Los Angeles) on an unconventional triangle flight itinerary. It ran from LA to sweet Cincinnati, Ohio to Dallas, Texas (where the institute was being held).</p>

  <p><b>Thursday (Ungodly Hours Included)</b>
  <br><br>
  The early morning included sighting a Bill Gates doppelganger and some sick skeleton/fossil displays at the Ohio airport (which also happens to be Northern Tennessee? the souvenirs are confusing us). One flight later, we finally make it to yeehaw county, the beautiful land of Dallas. 
  <br><br>
  Upon entering the hotel, staff lead us to the welcoming set up area. My shuttle bus group spreads out as we wait to be handed name tags and business cards, like cars at the go-stop traffic light before a highway. They lead us to another row of tables and… shirts? Jackets? A whole backpack?? Man, Bill really out there pampering us. (Honestly, I’m going to be using that backpack and a lot of the other free goodies at college.) 
  <br><br>
  After table-hopping to meet new people, stuffing my empty shell of a body with dearly missed food, and recieving a room key, I bounced out and settled down for a good half hour in my hotel room. And by god, it was gorgeous. Two queen-sized beds, an automated curtain, tons of space, and a shining bathroom. 
  <br><br>
  The next few hours consist of lunch, mixing around, and talking. Coming to this program, I talked myself into being a bit more openly social, to face my fear of “networking”. (Even though it’s more like just meeting a ton of new people in a short time span, in this case.) 
  <br><br>
  By the time dinner and a fireside chat (listening into a program leader’s conversation with an esteemed guest) rolls around, I’ve been awake for thirty hours (I couldn’t catch a wink of sleep on the plane). As much as I’d love to listen and learn from the speaker, I physically cannot stay focused. While I catch myself periodically nodding off, the stage’s deep purple curtain begins moving and east-asian languages fall like rain. The hallucinations have begun. 
  <br><br>
  Thankfully, the session concludes and we move onto team-building activities: fun-facts-about-each-other bingo (featuring all three hundred of us) and answering questions within the small groups we’ve been placed in with an intermission of late night snacks! I think. My brain was pretty fried by then. But that didn’t stop me from hanging out after we were released! I decided to tag along with a group of friends and strangers to the rooftop terrace to explore and take aesthetic nighttime photos. </p>

  <p><b>Friday</b>
  <br><br>
  Ring ring ring! An alarm goes off in my dream. Uhg I wish it would just sto-- oh wait, that’s my actual alarm. That’s my actual alarm! I have to get to breakfast in a half hour! My roommate and I hastily get ready and rush down. Breakfast includes a fireside chat with the amazing Anne Chow, an enthusiastic speaker and president of national business at AT&T. 
  <br><br>
  We’re being held to a strict schedule. Our day starts at around 7:45 am and ends at 11:00 pm and is packed full of activities separated by little 15-minute breaks. Contrary to yesterday, I actually have enough energy to stay focused during our morning lecture lessons (for the most part). 
  <br><br>
  <i>For those who are curious, we learned about the scholarship itself (what exactly did we win?), how to academically succeed in college, thriving in a diverse setting, and personal wellness.</i>
  <br><br>
  We’ve been assigned to sit with a new group for lunch, and eventually I realize that it’s not just any regular lunch. The event organizers have us answer questions with our groups to get to know one another better. Also, the food is fancy. Like unfamiliar fancy. My table group tries to dissect and understand each item, and I don’t think I’ve laughed harder at the event than now. By the way, throughout every non-breakfast meal, waiters walk around to make sure we’re keeping up professional dining etiquette like putting our bread plate on the right side, eating with the correct fork, and placing napkins on our laps. 
  <br><br>
  A few more lectures later, we’re listening to a panel of first-year college students provide miscellaneous advice and sharing what they’ve learned over the past few months. </p>
