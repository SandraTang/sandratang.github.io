      <p>Tuesday was the break between two busy periods, the valley between two mountains of activity. The weekend hosted a sleepover filled with Bob-Ross-inspired mug painting and pesto pasta cooking, and Monday consisted of an ice cream infused binge of Voltron. To top it all off, Wednesday saw the reuniting of me and a few Gates Scholars, followed by a delicious (large) meal at Maccheroni Republic, photoshoots in The Last Bookstore, and two shamelessly loud hours of karaoke. Tuesday? She was a humble break. A time of rest. Ok, well, not really. Responsibilities and MIT summer freshman deadlines stop for no one.
      <br><br>
      Tuesday morning. I head to work because, well, those essays won’t grade themselves. (And I need some pocket money to live out my senior summer dreams.)
      <br><br>
      For a few hours, I turn my brain off and completed normal office tasks including copying quizzes, roasting SAT essays, and delivering workbooks. I feel a bit nostalgic about my old days as a teacher, during the school year, but the class I taught isn’t available over the summer. Oh well. A girl gotta earn some money.
      <br><br>
      After a few hours in the front office of my local tutoring center, I return home to grab a quick bite of lunch (and squeeze in an episode of Voltron) before heading off to the doctor’s office.
      <br><br>
      A nurse records my blood pressure, height,  weight, and all that good stuff. As I stand rod-straight against height markings along the wall, the nurse mumbles, “Five four…” <i>Huh? Sis what?? Am I not,,, 5’5”? Ma’am, I’m small. Please show some mercy.</i>
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      (Thankfully, when I got the report back, it said the rightful height of 5’5”.)
      <br><br>
      I baked in the car for a good half hour while my dad and I drove back home. Upon reaching my front door, I ran in, turned on the fan, and went into full <b>r e l a x a t i o n</b> mode. Netflix? Open. Food? In my lap. Tuesday? Over.</p>
