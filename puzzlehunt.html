      <h4>Where It All Begins...</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Tim was on track for Gliese 581. He had a very important ExtraSuperUROP project to complete there, and he was running a little late. So when his spaceship started making a few concerning sounds, he shrugged it off: he could run some diagnostics after his project was done. He wasn’t prepared for how quickly the noises would get worse. Or for the steering to cut out -- right as a planet loomed up in front of him. No matter how hard he pulled the emergency brake, nothing happened. And the planet was getting closer and closer… He closed his eyes and hoped for the best.</p>
      <p>Boom!</p>
      <p>He opened his eyes to a wide brown sky. To his left was nothing but dust and dirt. To his right was his spaceship. Or what used to be his spaceship; now it was more like a pile of parts. And behind him--</p>
      <p>“Ahhh!”</p>
      <p>Behind him were five creatures. Five aliens! One of them opened its mouth and said... “brrbflx”?</p>
      <p>“Hi, uh, sorry, I don’t know what that means. Who are you? Can you help me fix my spaceship?”</p>
      <p>“Brrbflx!”</p>
      <p>Tim had a feeling it was going to be a looooooong time before he saw MIT again.</p>

      <h4>About the First-Year Puzzle Hunt</h4>
      <br>
      <p>“Where in the galaxy is Tim the Beaver?” is a multi-round puzzle hunt where teams of first-year students compete to identify the location of Tim the Beaver after his communications with mission control break down during space travel to Pluto. The puzzle hunt is designed to be an interactive experience for first-year students to connect with peers and HASS faculty while engaging in fun low-stakes intellectual activities. The hunt will consist of puzzles based on HASS content, optional ties to HASS curricular activities that build communication skills, and a team-based Rube Goldberg challenge that showcases the exciting intersections of engineering and HASS. Using standalone thematic rounds, the hunt will allow students to work with up to six different teams over the course of the semester, connecting them with a broad range of classmates and allowing them to easily opt-in or out of specific rounds based on interest and availability. The hunt will be designed and implemented by a team of student puzzle-writers, staff in the Office of the Vice Chancellor, and faculty members in SHASS.</p>
